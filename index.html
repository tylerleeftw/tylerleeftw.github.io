<h1>Do you know Ty?</h1>

<p>At first glance, this looks like a simple question. Of course you know Ty. 
The guy whose website this is. You clicked on the link because he posted it, 
and you were bored or maybe even just curious. Do you know him? Let's see... 
You met him during freshman year at a party where he was either very drunk, 
very high, or both. No? Oh I know! You met him in a lecture hall for a computer 
science course where he was there just because participation was required. No? Okay.
Maybe you met him at RIMAC. That skinny dude who always crossed people over. 
Or maybe you didn't even meet this guy before, and you somehow just came across 
this link. </p>

<p>Well I'm just going to answer this question for you. You don't know me. 
Argue it all you want, but let's face it. You don't really know who I am. 
Who I TRULY am. You might know certain things about me such as where I am from, 
what my hobbies are, and the fact that I like to use onions in my cooking. 
But I don't think you know what I stand for, what I think about certain things, and 
what I think is worth mentioning out of all the things that happen in this crazy 
thing called life. To be honest, even I don't know who I really am yet. But I think through 
this website, with each blog entry, music posting, or whatever else I post on here, 
you will start to learn about who I really am. The same goes for me. During this process, 
I will learn about myself as well. This is a journey that we are about to go on together. Let's 
just have some fun.</p>
